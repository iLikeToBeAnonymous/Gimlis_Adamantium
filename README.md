# MoveableUnbreakableBlocksFor7DaysToDie
<h2>Simple mod for 7 Days to Die (7D2D) that adds some craftable, unbreakable blocks to the game. They can be picked up like wood frames.</h2>
<p>The blocks share the meshes, textures, and icons of stainless steel blocks, but have the game "material" of bedrock â€” meaning neither players nor zombies can break them. They are meant to serve as "plating" on the outside of a structure.</p>
<p>While this breaks one of the key mechanics of the game, it is meant to encourage fortress building for people who find it frustrating to have to keep repairing their base of expensive materials after every hoarde night. The quick-pickup feature may also be able to be exploited.</p>
